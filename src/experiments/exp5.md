# Experiment 5

## Variations and Extended Study
Multiple experimental variations and different approaches.

## Quantum Mechanics Basics
The Schrödinger equation governs quantum systems:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\psi$$

Where:
- **ψ** is the wave function
- **ℏ** is the reduced Planck constant
- **Ĥ** is the Hamiltonian operator

## Version 1: Classical Approach
Study classical approximations first.

## Version 2: Quantum Approach
Investigate quantum mechanical behavior.

## Comparative Analysis
Compare results from different experimental methodologies.

## Conclusions
Understanding the transition between classical and quantum regimes.
