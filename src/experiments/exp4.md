# Experiment 4

## Thermodynamics Study
Investigating principles of heat and temperature.

## First Law of Thermodynamics
The internal energy of a system changes according to:

$$dU = \delta Q - \delta W$$

Where:
- **dU** is the change in internal energy
- **δQ** is the heat added to the system
- **δW** is the work done by the system

## Experimental Variables
- Initial temperature: 25°C
- Final temperature: 100°C
- Heat source: Bunsen burner
- Measurement interval: 10 seconds

## Data Collection
Record temperature changes over time with a thermometer.

## Analysis
Calculate heat transfer and work performed.
