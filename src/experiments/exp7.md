# Magnetic Blackbox

## Interactive Magnetic Experiment
Exploring unknown magnetic field configurations.

## Magnetic Field Theory
The magnetic field exerts a force on moving charges:

$$\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})$$

Where:
- **F** is the magnetic force
- **q** is the charge
- **v** is the velocity
- **B** is the magnetic field

## Experimental Objective
Determine the internal configuration of the black box through external measurements.

## Measurement Tools
- Compass
- Magnetic field sensor
- Small charged particles

## Investigation Methods
1. Map the field pattern
2. Identify pole locations
3. Estimate field strength
4. Determine field configuration

## Expected Results
Understanding the hidden magnetic structure through external observation.
