# Experiment 1

## Introduction
This is the first physics olympiad experiment exploring fundamental principles.

## Key Concepts
The most famous equation in physics relates energy and mass:

$$E = mc^2$$

Where:
- **E** is energy (Joules)
- **m** is mass (kilograms)
- **c** is the speed of light ($3 \times 10^8$ m/s)

## Procedure
1. Prepare the experimental apparatus
2. Calibrate all measuring instruments
3. Take measurements at regular intervals
4. Record all observations

## Results
Analyze the data to verify the relationship between variables.

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates fundamental physics principles.
