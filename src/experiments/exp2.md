# Experiment 2

## Overview
Exploring experimental physics with comprehensive asset documentation.

## Newton's Laws
The second law of motion states:

$$F = ma$$

Where:
- **F** is force (Newtons)
- **m** is mass (kg)
- **a** is acceleration (m/s²)

## Key Measurements
- Force applied: 10 N
- Mass of object: 2 kg
- Expected acceleration: 5 m/s²

## Experimental Setup
Multiple assets and resources are used for this experiment.

## Analysis
Compare theoretical predictions with experimental observations.
