In this experiment, a non-conducting charged disk of radius R and uniform surface charge density of Ïƒ, 
is placed on a plane described with ax + by + cz = 1;
its center is located at C = (x_c, y_c, z_c). Your task is to find all these unknown parameters.

(Note: The program allows infinite precision and does not include any measurement error)

The experiment is simulated in the 0 <= x, y, z <= (10 meters) cube. It is guaranteed that the entirety of this disk is within this cube. 

The program has 2 operating modes:

- Mode A: You input three coordinate values, and the electric potential of this point is calculated for you.

- Mode B: You input three numbers that indicate the number of points that you are going to divide each axis into.
(num_x * num_y * num_z points will be measured.) 
This creates a discrete cubical lattice of inputted dimensions and outputs the potential of ALL these points.
I recommend not going above 4000 or 8000 measurements. (Do not enter any number higher than 20)

The data will be written to a file named "result.txt," probably inside the same folder as the .exe file or the folder outside it.

FYI: This data can be easily ported over to excel from this text format.
